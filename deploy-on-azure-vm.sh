# This script deploys Joget DX 8 on an Azure VM using Terraform and Ansible.
# It initializes Terraform, applies the configuration to create the VM,
# retrieves the public IP address of the VM, and then runs an Ansible playbook to
# install Joget DX 8 on the VM.
# Ensure you have the necessary tools installed:
# - Terraform
# - Ansible
# - Ansible community.mysql collection (ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql)
# - Azure CLI (az)
# - SSH access to the VM (private key should be in ~/.ssh/azure_id_rsa)
# Ensure you have the necessary permissions and configurations set up in Azure.
# Ensure you have the Joget DX 8 tarball available at the specified download URL in the Ansible playbook.
